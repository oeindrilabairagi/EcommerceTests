# EcommerceTests

This project automates functional UI testing for the LambdaTest E-commerce Playground homepage using TestCafe.
It verifies major interactive components such as navigation tabs, banners, product cards, hover actions, and blog links.

**Prerequisites**
Before running the tests, make sure you have:
- Node.js (v16 or higher) installed
- npm or yarn package manager
- TestCafe installed globally or locally

**Install TestCafe globally (recommended):**
npm install -g testcafe

**Running the Test**
- Open the project folder in VS Code (or your preferred terminal) and import homepage_test_v2.js
- Run the following command to execute the test in Chrome:
  npx testcafe chrome homepage_test_v2.js --skip-js-errors --skip-uncaught-errors --screenshots screenshots --assertion-timeout 8000 --page-load-timeout 10000
- Wait for the run to complete â€” the terminal will display each test step and its PASS/FAIL status.
- Screenshots of failed steps (if any) will be automatically saved inside the /screenshots folder created during execution.
